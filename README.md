After creating https://github.com/DutchJavaDev/WebPageCreatorPOC I want to automate it using this project.

This will be a functions app running in azure that will act as a webhook (secured by a admin secret to prevent spam calls) that will be called/triggered when I update on of my repo's to update my github webpage for me
https://dutchjavadev.github.io/

Reason? I am lazy and also it gives a view of wat I am working on and wat I have worked on (handy for recruitersðŸ˜œ who want to recruit me)
